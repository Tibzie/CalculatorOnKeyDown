CalculatorOnKeyDown

About the project
---

It was one of my assignment that I was required to do at QA Consulting as a trainee.
In order to use the calculator, users need to press down keys to interact with the project.
The website also includes a section next to the calculator which keys can be pressed and which key belongs to which character (numbers, operators etc.)

Challenge

It was quite challenging. I had worked with JavaScript before, but I have never actually tried to go this far.
When I finished my assignment it did not look as "good" as it is now.
I have done some extra research on how to represent visually when a button is pressed.

When I first created the on keydown calculator, it consisted of fewer buttons.
Therefore, I felt it's necessary to add a few more to make it more *"user-friendly"*.
For example, deleting a character, clearing the screen and allowing users to do advanced calculator features.

I learned how to effectively use OnKeyDown method effectively as well using JavaScript with HTML and CSS.


Future improvements

Adding new buttons and adding validation.
